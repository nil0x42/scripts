# A command which takes a raw list of domain names
# as stdin, and returns a short, optimized for common
# subdomain for online enumeration for example.

# For wordlist optimization, only subdomains that where found at
# least 2 times in the list are kept. The list is sorted by subdomain
# frequency>

# Example of usage:
# ~$ sqlite3 ~/.mozilla/firefox/places.sqlite 'select * from moz_hosts' |
#       cut -d'|' -f2 |
#       subdomain-crunch
